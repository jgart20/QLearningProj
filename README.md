# QLearningProj
In this project, there are three main files:

## MazeGenerator
This file generates a new maze of a given size, filled with zeroes, one X, and one F. It is called upon in the QTraining file.

## QLearning
This is a slightly modified version of a file found off of technobium.com that is the basis of a simple Q Learning algorithm. It was modified to work more seamlessly with the project by having a method added that prints data to a txt file.

## QTraining
This is the "driver" for the project, in which both QLearning and MazeGenerator are called upon. In order to run the project, this is the file that must be used.
